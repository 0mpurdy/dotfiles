# Keyboard tips

## Backtick on Magicforce68

If an ANSI keyboard is in UK mode and there are some keys that you can't access the
following combinations will serve as an alternative

These have been tested on a Magicforce68, which lacks a function row, and
therefore may have some non-standard behaviour.

| Key     | Name      | Chord                     |
| ---     | ---       | ---                       |
| `\`     | Backslash | `AltGr` + `-`             |
| `|`     | Pipe      | `AltGr` + `Shift` + `Esc` |
| `` ` `` | Backtick  | `AltGr` + `#` + `#`       |
| `` ` `` | Backtick  | `Fn` + `Esc`              |

On a ANSI Vortex Cypher the following mappings apply

| Key     | Name      | Chord                   |
| ---     | ---       | ---                     |
| `\`     | Backslash | `AltGr` + `\`           |
| `|`     | Pipe      | `AltGr` + `Shift` + `\` |
| `` ` `` | Backtick  | `Fn` + `Esc`            |
