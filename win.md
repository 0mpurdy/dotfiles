# Windows configuration

## Windows subsystem for Linux

Install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#complete-initialization-of-your-distro) so that you don't have to use windows.

If you don't have access to the store, you can [download the package manually](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) and [extract it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-on-server).

## Dotfiles

You can push and pull the windows dotfiles using the script in `win/scripts` of this repo.
